The ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause in MySQL is used to handle situations where a row being inserted has a unique constraint violation (e.g., duplicate email in this case). Instead of throwing an error, it updates specific columns in the existing row.

How It Works in the Example:
---------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO kunder (name, email) 
VALUES ('$name', '$email') 
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id)
---------------------------------------------

1. Insert:
Attempts to insert the new name and email into the kunder table.
2. Duplicate Key:
If the email column has a unique constraint (or is a PRIMARY KEY) and the email value already exists in the table, MySQL will detect a conflict.
3. Action on Duplicate:
Instead of throwing an error, it runs the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause.
In this case, the clause updates the id column to itself (id = id) so no actual change is made.
4. LAST_INSERT_ID(id):
Ensures that the last inserted or updated row's id is returned as the result of the query, regardless of whether it was a new insert or an update.


Why Use It?
-Unified Handling: It allows you to treat both new users and existing users with the same query.
If it's a new user, their id is generated and inserted.
If it's an existing user, their id is updated to itself (no real change), but the id is still retrieved.
-Retrieve the User ID: Using LAST_INSERT_ID(id) ensures that you can reliably get the id of the user, whether they were just inserted or already existed in the table.


Example Use Case:
Assume your kunder table looks like this:

CREATE TABLE kunder (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    maskrosor INT DEFAULT 10
);

If the following query is executed:

INSERT INTO kunder (name, email) 
VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com') 
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id);

Scenario 1: New User:
No user with email = 'alice@example.com' exists.
A new row is inserted:
id: 1, name: Alice, email: alice@example.com, maskrosor: 10
The id (1) is retrieved.

Scenario 2: Existing User:
A user with email = 'alice@example.com' already exists (e.g., id = 1).
The row is not changed (the id is updated to itself).
The id (1) is retrieved.


Practical Use in the Example:
This approach ensures:

The id of the user is always retrieved, regardless of whether they were newly added or already existed.
You can reliably store the user's id in the session for later use.
